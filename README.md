## Bookstore App

Not so much a bookstore as a reading list, I'm calling this web-app "My Reading Room." It consists of a back end server created with nodejs by our awesome instructors [Matina Patsos](https://github.com/matinaspatsos) and [Jamal Taylor](https://github.com/Louis345). The UI consists of a four main components â€” Navbar, Search, Book Details and My Books. The Navbar has links to Search and My Books. The Search page allows one to search for books and then select from a list of results to find out more about a specific book. Book Details provides more detailed information about a specific book and lets the user add it to My Books. My Books lists a user's books in three categories: Future Reads, Currently Reading and Already Read, and allows users to switch books to different categories or remove them completely.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
