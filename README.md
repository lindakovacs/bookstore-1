## Bookstore App

Not so much a bookstore as a book organizer, I'm calling this web-app "My Reading Room." It consists of a back end server created with nodejs by our awesome instructors [Matina Patsos](https://github.com/matinaspatsos) and [Jamal Taylor](https://github.com/Louis345). The front end consists of a four main components. There's a navbar with links to the Search and My Books pages. There's a Search page where one can search for books to add to his or her reading list. There's the My Books page which lists books in three categories: Future Reads, Currently Reading and Already Read, and allows users to switch books to different categories or remove them completely. Finally, there's a Book Details page which allows the reader to view more detailed information about a specific book. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
